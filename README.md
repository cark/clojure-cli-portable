# Clojure-cli-portable
An unofficial Clojure command line replacement
## What is it
The new Clojure CLI is great, but we're having issues on Windows as described [here](https://github.com/cark/clojure-windows-cli-issues).

I first made an [exploratory wrapper](https://github.com/cark/clojure-win-cli-wrap) to the existing [Powershell implementation](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows), and it works well enough, but we're still paying a hefty startup time penalty by calling into Powershell. So this project was born, a reimplementation of the powershell/bash scripts as small binary executable, writen with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).
## Project goal
- We're exploring the possibilities and hope to have Cognitect adopt this or something like it. 
- The project was made portable to demonstrate the feasability of a single implementation for all platforms.
- Nim was chosen because it's easy to read, produces small executables, and is portable. 
- I purposefully tried to maintain the shape of the existing bash script (almost line for line), and kept the same variable names so that this would be easy to transition to.
## Benefits
- command line parity between windows and the official posix cli
- tools like Cider jack-in on deps.edn, and shadow-cljs with deps.edn work on Windows
- no need to lower the security of your Powershell by setting a permissive execution policy
- fast
- small
- source code is quite readable
- cross-compilation from linux and/or docker to linux and windows
- a pretty installer for windows
## Binaries 
- Windows binaries are provided in the [Releases page](https://github.com/cark/clojure-cli-portable/releases)
- An installer is also provided there
## Build from source
### All platforms
- the `version.txt` file must contain the current version string of the clojure tools
### Windows
#### Requirements
- a Windows computer or VM
- a recent [Nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html)
- [Java](https://jdk.java.net) installed and in the path
#### Building
from the project directory, execute this command in the console :
```
script\build
```
You'll find the resulting zip file in the `out` directory.
#### Installing
- Uninstall any previously installed Clojure command line tool
- Unzip anywhere you like
- Add to the path
### Linux
!!! The official command line is good enough on Linux !!!

While the Linux build works on my machine, it only serves to demonstrate the feasability of a single implementation for all platforms.
#### Requirements
- a Linux computer or VM
- a recent [Nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/install_unix.html)
- (optional) mingw-w64 required for cross compilation to windows
- (optional) [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) for cross-compilation of the windows installer

#### Building
First we need the official clojure-tools.
From the project directory, execute this command in the terminal :
```
script/download
```

Then we want to build the Linux version
From the project directory, execute this command in the terminal :
```
script/build
```
You'll find the resulting zip file in the `out/linux` directory.

We might want to build the windows version
From the project directory, execute this command in the terminal :
```
script/build_win
```
You'll find the resulting zip file in the `out/win` directory.

The windows installer. This step requires that the windows build be executed first.
From the project directory, execute this command in the terminal :
```
script/nsis
```
You'll find the resulting installer executable in the `out/win` directory.

All these steps may be done in a single call :
```
script/build_all
```
#### Installing 
- Unpack anywhere you like
- symlink from one of your bin directories
- Set executable permissions where needed
### Docker
We can build it all with the provided Dockerfile. This will :
- use the official docker ubuntu image
- apt get all the things required to compile for Linux and Windows
- cross compile binaries for both platforms 
- build the Windows installer

The first run will be pretty long as we need to setup the image.
The image will end up at a almost 4gb.
Following runs are pretty fast.
#### Requirements
- Docker up and running
#### Building
from the project directory, execute this command in the terminal :
```
script/docker_build
```
The result will be placed in `dockerout/`
### Mac
While I haven't tested this at all, I think this can be built on Mac too, with maybe some slight adjustments in
the build scripts... Once again, the official scripts are good enough there.
## Changes
A few minor changes were made to the original scripts
- the cache\_key includes the project\_version in order to refresh the cache on clojure cli version change
- cache file names are md5 based instead of crc based
- we're purposefully ignoring ctrl-c, and let the JVM handle it.
- added an experimental fix to [TDEP-120](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/TDEPS-120), as well as a new switch -Scp-jar that will force the creation and usage of a classpath jar

## Prior art
I'm not the first one : 
- a [go implementation](https://github.com/frericksm/clj-windows)
- a [node implementation](https://github.com/thheller/clojure-cli)
